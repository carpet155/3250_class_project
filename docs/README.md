# Regime-based Analysis of Sector Returns under Varying Macroeconomic Conditions

This project analyzes the impact between the macro environment under different economic conditions and various stock market sectors. The goal is to examine the volatility of these sectors in distinct regimes such as; high inflation + rising rates and low inflation + falling rates.

## Rough Goals 

- Define and classify macroeconomic regimes of interest(e.g., high vs. low inflation, rising vs. falling interest rates) to simplify interpretation in relation to stock market sectors; also defining sectors of interest(e.g., technology, healthcare, energy).
- Build a clean merged dataset combining economic indicators and stock market sector-level data.
- Evaluate how sector returns differ across defined macroeconomic regimes, identifying consistent performance trends.
- Identify and analyze changes in sector volatility under economic stress conditions vrs, stable economic conditions.
- Apply NumPy numerical and statistical computations alongside Pandas data analysis in an well-organized and efficient Python script.
- Share all scripts and changes to main branch.
